 Here's a quick summary of where we are so you can pick up later:

  Current Status:

  Goal: Add stock price scraping + multi-page structure (Landing, News, Stock Prices pages)

  Key Decisions Made:
  1. ✅ Track ~600 stocks (S&P 500, NASDAQ-100, Dow Jones)
  2. ✅ Collect 4 prices per day with historical data
  3. ✅ Use Finnhub API (free tier: 60 calls/min - perfect for 600 stocks)
  4. ✅ Stock prices page will show API documentation (like news page)

  Next Steps When You Return:
  1. I'll create a complete implementation plan
  2. You'll review and approve it
  3. Then I'll implement:
    - Database schema for stock prices
    - Finnhub integration
    - Cron job for 4x daily fetching
    - API endpoints for stock data
    - Multi-page frontend structure (Landing → News → Stocks)

  What You'll Need:
  - Finnhub API key (free - sign up at https://finnhub.io/)
  - Add to environment variables when ready
I have added the api keys of finnhub to .env
  Your codebase is unchanged and ready for when you return. Just let me know when you want to continue! 👍
